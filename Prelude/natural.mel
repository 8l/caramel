-- Natural numbers can be defined as `Nat = Succ Nat | Zero`.
--
-- Caramel's syntax sugar expand ASCII numbers to church-encoded numbers.  
-- They implement `n` applications of a function. For example,
-- (4 f x) is the same as (f (f (f (f x))))
--
-- Some algebraic operations can be then defined very naturally.
--
-- Addition of `a` and `b` is simply applying `succ` `a` times to
-- zero, then applying `succ` `b` times to zero. It could be defined
-- as just `add a b = (a succ (b succ zero))`, but lifting the succ
-- and zero constructors allows for fusions.
--
-- Multiplication of `a` and `b` is just applying `(add b)` `a` times
-- to `zero`. It could be defined as `mul a b = (a (add b))`, but again,
-- lifting `succ` is more efficient.
--
-- Others not so much. Subtraction, division, predecessor and
-- modulus are tricky, and I'm still unsure what is the best 
-- implementation for them.
--
-- Comparison operations like `<=` are often defined inefficiently on literature.
-- An improved version creates two continuators that call eachother while
-- simultaneously folding down the natural number until it reaches the "zero".
-- When it does, it outputs either `true` or `false`, depending on which number
-- reached "zero" first.
--
-- Fib is implemented efficiently as an interactive sequence.
